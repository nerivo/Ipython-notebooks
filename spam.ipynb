      "### Parsing and tokenizing the e-mails\n",
      "\n",
      "We're going to use NLTK's `wordpunct_tokenize` function to break the message into tokens. This splits tokens at white space and (most) punctuation marks, and returns the punctuation along with the tokens on each side. So `\"I don't know. Do you?\"` becomes `[\"I\", \"don\", \"'\", \"t\", \"know\", \".\", \"Do\", \"you\", \"?\"]`.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you look through some of the training e-mails in `train_spam_messages` and `train_ham_messages`, you'll notice a few features that make extracting words tricky.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, there are a couple of odd text artefacts. The string '3D' shows up in strange places in HTML attributes and other places, and we'll remove these. Furthermore there seem to be some mid-word line wraps flagged with an '=' where the word is broken across lines. For example, the work 'apple' might be split across lines like 'app=\\nle'.  We want to strip these out so we can recover 'apple'. We'll want to deal with all these first, before we apply the tokenizer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, there's a lot of HTML in the messages. We'll have to decide first whether we want to keep HTML info in our set of words. If we do, we'll apply `wordpunct_tokenize` to some HTML, for example:\n",
      "\n",
      "`\"<HEAD></HEAD><BODY><!-- Comment -->\"`\n",
      "\n",
      "and it will tokenize to:\n",
      "\n",
      "`[\"<\", \"HEAD\", \"></\", \"HEAD\", \"><\", \"BODY\", \"><!--\", \"Comment\", \"-->\"]`\n",
      "\n",
      "So if we drop the punctuation tokens, and get the unique set of what remains, we'd have `{\"HEAD\", \"BODY\", \"Comment\"}`, which seems like what we'd want. For example, it's nice that this method doesn't make, `<HEAD>` and `</HEAD>` separate words in our set, but just captures the existence of this tag with the term `\"HEAD\"`. It might be a problem that we won't distinguish between the HTML tag `<HEAD>` and \"head\" used as an English word in the message. But for the moment I'm willing to bet that sort of conflation won't have a big affect on the classifier.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we don't want to count HTML information in our set of words, we can set the `strip_html` to `True`, and we'll take all the HTML tags out before tokenizing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly we'll strip out any \"stopwords\" from the set. Stopwords are highly common, therefore low information words, like \"a\", \"the\", \"he\", etc. Below I'll use `stopwords`, downloaded from NLTK's corpus library, with a minor modifications to deal with this. (In other programs I've used the stopwords exported from R's `tm` package.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that because our tokenizer splits contractions (\"she'll\" $\\rightarrow$ \"she\", \"ll\"), we'd like to drop the ends (\"ll\"). Some of these may be picked up in NLTK's `stopwords` list, others we'll manually add. It's an imperfect, but easy solution. There are more sophisticated ways of dealing with this which are overkill for our purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tokenizing, as perhaps you can tell, is a non-trivial operation. NLTK has a host of other tokenizing functions of varying sophistication, and even lets you define your own tokenizing rule using regex."
